			<h1>Internet Explorer detected</h1>
		</div>
		<p>
			We have detected that you're using an older version of Internet Explorer to attempt to view this resume. Internet Explorer is actually horrible. It's so horrible, <a href="https://www.modern.ie/en-us/ie6countdown">even Microsoft wants you to stop using it.</a> I didn't even make a page to detect older versions of other browsers, because the update mechanisms in other browsers are actually decent, and the odds of you using, like, Chrome v6 are ridiculously improbable.

		<p>
			It's literally just IE that's horrible enough to get its own failure page.

			This site is supposed to be a tech demo for showing that I know how to code in modern languages, like CSS3 and HTML5. If you want to see all that fancy stuff, you'll need to access the site with a modern browser. But I've made a Whiteboard web app that's designed to be compatible with earlier versions of IE, which you can check out if you want to make sure I can code for older browsers, as well as new. Once you're done checking it out, unless this is a test of the compatibility of my code, I strongly recommend seeking the aid of a mental health professional. If you're using IE willingly, it's a clear indicator of outstanding mental health issues.

			You may also access my resume in PDF or Microsoft Word formats. If you're having trouble opening these files you need to get Adobe Rea- actually...if you can't open either a PDF or a DOC...then I don't want to work for your company. Seriously, what is this, the stone age? I wish you the best of luck finding another candidate.
